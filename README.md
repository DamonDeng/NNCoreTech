# Neural Network Visualizer

An interactive web application that demonstrates neural network concepts through visual demonstrations. This project helps users understand the fundamentals of neural networks through hands-on, interactive visualizations.

## Project Overview

This application provides:
- Interactive visualization of neural network architectures
- Step-by-step demonstrations of how neural networks process data
- Visual explanations of key concepts like activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent
- Real-time demonstrations of neural network training and inference

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/DamonDeng/NNCoreTech.git

2. Install dependencies:

bash
npm install


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
